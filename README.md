# tnlfalcon
An example Falcon project with static resource and a planned DB/login facility

This is for a talk at OpenWest 2018, and beyond the talk I'd like to add a working solution with a postgres backed users and sessions solution that you can actually log into (with a very basic frontend SPA).

Current status: it is talk ready and runs fine against postman for examples, and displays the index page.  No DB scripts, tests, or transaction management yet.  Auth example works, though, just hard coded.
